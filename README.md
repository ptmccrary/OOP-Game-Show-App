# OOP Game Show App
 
This project uses Object Oriented Programing and JavaScript to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess.

a random phrase, split the phrase into letters, will generate and put those letters onto the gameboard. 

Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen. 

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears. 

A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, that letter will be disabled on the onscreen keyboard
